ABOUT ----------------------------------------

Space Turkeys is aiming to be a simple yet complex strategy game in
space setting. The game is built for simultaneous turns multiplayer
mode.

BUILD ---------------------------------------- 

In order to build Space Turkeys, you must first install the
dependencies. Space Turkeys uses boost, plus SFML and TGUI which are
submodules to this repository. Thus, either clone with '--recursive'
or run 'git submodule init' and 'git submodule update' to get the
submodule contents. Then you will need the following libraries which
SFML depends on:

pthread
opengl
xlib
xrandr
udev
freetype
glew
jpeg
sndfile
openal
xcb-image

After they are installed, a simple './configure && make && make
install' should in the future be sufficient to build both dependencies
and the Space Turkeys executables. However, tgui cmakelists requires
that sfml be built before tgui is configured, and I have not figured
out how to get automake to generate a makefile where building tgui
depends on configuring tgui. For now this means either run make twice
so that the second time the condition is met, or comment out the dep
check section in tgui cmakelists:

# # FindSFML couldn't find SFML.
# if( NOT SFML_FOUND )
#     set( SFML_ROOT "" CACHE PATH "SFML root directory" )
#     message( FATAL_ERROR "CMake couldn't find SFML. Set the SFML_ROOT entry to SFML's root directory (containing \"include\" and \"lib\" directories)." )
# endif()

RUN ----------------------------------------

To start a game with N players, run 'st_server N' on one
machine. Then, each player runs 'st_client server_ip_address'. The
server should start the game once all N players have connected.
