ABOUT ----------------------------------------

Space Turkeys is aiming to be a simple yet complex strategy game in
space setting. The game is built for simultaneous turns multiplayer
mode.

BUILD ---------------------------------------- 

In order to build Space Turkeys, you must first install the
dependencies. Space Turkeys uses boost, plus SFML and TGUI which are
submodules to this repository. Thus, either clone with '--recursive'
or run 'git submodule init' and 'git submodule update' to get the
submodule contents. Then you will need the following libraries which
SFML depends on:

pthread
opengl
xlib
xrandr
udev
freetype
glew
jpeg
sndfile
openal
xcb-image

After they are installed, a simple './configure && make && make install' 
should be sufficient to build both dependencies and the Space Turkeys
executables.

RUN ----------------------------------------

To start a game with N players, run 'st_server N' on one
machine. Then, each player runs 'st_client server_ip_address'. The
server should start the game once all N players have connected.
