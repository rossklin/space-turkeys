ABOUT ----------------------------------------

Space Turkeys is aiming to be a simple yet complex strategy game in
space setting. The game is built for simultaneous turns multiplayer
mode.

BUILD ---------------------------------------- 

In order to build Space Turkeys, you must first install the
dependencies. Space Turkeys uses boost's random libraries, plus SFML
and SFGUI graphics libraries. Then use autotools, i.e. run autoreconf
to get a configure script and then ./configure && make.

RUN ----------------------------------------

To start a game with N players, run 'st_server N' on one
machine. Then, each player runs 'st_client server_ip_address'. The
server should start the game once all N players have connected (a more
user friendly approach will probably be adopted later).
