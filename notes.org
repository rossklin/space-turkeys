** before game interface
* remember
** when updating a struct/class, also update serialization
* fixed
** fixed operator <<(packet, solar)
** added solar to drawing
** removed id attributes (stored in has map pair)
** added player to game_data 
** client game_data g0 should update after simulation
   replaced socket_t by socket_t* in query function

   apparently, passing ref(socket_t) (probably its the
   ref(sf::Packet?) to thread causes ~thread() which in turn causes
   abort
** server receives choice
   related to copying packets - fixed by using client_t* instead of
   client_t in queue.  

   gets n=-9744, for some reason still enters push loop. Test run with
   &&res in loop condition. Check if n is wrong from start.
